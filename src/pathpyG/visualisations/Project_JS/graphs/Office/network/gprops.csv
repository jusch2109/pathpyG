description,"A temporal network of contacts between individuals, measured in an office building in France, from June 24 to July 3, 2013.

The data set comprises two files. The first one contains a tab-separated list representing the active contacts during 20-second intervals of the data collection. Each line has the form “t i j”, where i and j are the anonymous IDs of the persons in contact, and the interval during which this contact was active is [ t – 20s, t ] (t is expressed in seconds since the time origin taken as 0:00 on June 24, 2013).

The second file contains a list of the form “i Di” where i is the anonymous ID of an individual and Di the name of his/her department in the workplace.
