description,"A network of proximity contacts measured between members of 5 households of rural Kenya, between April 24 and May 12, 2012.

Each file in the downloadable package contains a comma-separated list representing each measured contact between any two household members (member 1 and member 2) over three days of experiment. The first file stores the contacts recorded between members of the same household, the second file stores the contacts between members of different households.

Each line has the form: “h1, m1, h2, m2, age1, age2, sex1, sex2, duration, day, hour”, where:

    h1 is the household of member 1; h1=[L, F, E, B, H]
    m1 is the anonymous ID number of member 1;
    h2 is the household of member 2; h2=[L, F, E, B, H]
    m2 is the anonymous ID number of member 2;
    age1 is the age of member 1; age1 = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
    age2 is the age of member 2; age2 = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
    sex1 is the gender of member 1; sex1 = [F, M]
    sex2 is the gender of member 2; sex2 = [F, M]
    duration is the duration of the contact event in seconds;
    day is the day of experiment; day = [1, 2, 3]
    hour is the day time of the contact event; hour = [7 – 20]
